# CircuitPython_CLUE_Menu
Make your Adafruit [CLUE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500) multifunctional by adding a nifty startup menu to select the program you want to run. You no longer need to retitle you files to main.py

## Dependencies
This library depends on:
* [Adafruit CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython)
* [Adafruit_CircuitPython_CLUE](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CLUE)

## Instalations
Follow Adafruit's [CLUE Overview](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-clue) instructions under _CircuitPython on CLUE_. During the installation process, you will download the latest _library bundle_ and transfer several libraries to the CLUE, including the __Adafruit_CircuitPython_CLUE__.
Download this repository and copy _main.py_ and _menu.py_ over to your drive CIRCUITPY. 

## Usage
The scripts will automatically run at startup. You don't need to do anything else after installation.
If you wish to disable the menu and run another file at start up I suggest modifying main.py. Main.py is a simple redirect script and is a lot easier than constantly renaming files.
```python

```
